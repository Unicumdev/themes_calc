# themes_calc
A simple calculator with different themes. The selection of themes with names is carried out in the right panel. The calculator buttons respond to user clicks. The buttons for selecting themes are also interactive. During the development of the project, the number of themes will increase, I will make a "random selection" button and add functionality for arithmetic calculations.
